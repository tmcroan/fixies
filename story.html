              <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
              <h2>It's not where you're going, but it's how you get there. We couldn't agree more. We believe your bicycle should be an extension of your life. Your bike should be adventurous, it should be exhilerating... it should be epic. Fixies Bikes are you; they're your mobile canvas. <br>          <img src="pics/bikeshop.jpg" alt="Fixies Bikes Storefront" id="storefront"><br/>
 Fixies Bikes was founded in 2003 by a group of friends who were fed up with the state of bicyles in the city. With shared vision and determination, we set out to introduce high performance, stylish, and affordable bicycles to the planet.</h2>
